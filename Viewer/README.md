# Setup
Following setup is used in this experiment.

- Datasets are raw txt files with numbers

```
13786
11979
16525
30653
18735
12201
12511
```

- All datapoints are applied DSC

```
tPosition _Position;
_Position.x = vValues[a] - vValues[a-1];
_Position.y = vValues[a-1] - vValues[a-2];
_Position.z = vValues[a-2] - vValues[a-3];
```

- Then values are normalized to `<0,1>` so the datapoints once rendered will fit this range in 3D space.

```
_Position.x = (_Position.x-iMinValue)/(iMaxValue-iMinValue);
_Position.y = (_Position.y-iMinValue)/(iMaxValue-iMinValue);
_Position.z = (_Position.z-iMinValue)/(iMaxValue-iMinValue);
```

# Random numbers
Random and Pseudorandom Data: Begin with sequences of random or pseudorandom numbers generated by different algorithms.

Random numbers are values that are generated unpredictably or without a discernible pattern. They are used in various applications across mathematics, science, statistics, computer science, and many other fields. Random numbers play a crucial role in simulations, games, cryptography, and statistical analysis, among other areas.

## Linux
Data obtained with the use of `generate2.sh`.

Outcomes: _Perfect randomness_ - by the looks of the visualization - no patterns, random distribution of points in the space.

## RANDOM WALK
Utilize a distributed network of ESP32 nodes to perform independent Random Walk simulations, generating datasets that can be visualized using Delayed Space Coordinates to search for complex, attractor-like structures.The DSC technique is applied to transform the time series data from the Random Walk into a multidimensional phase space, making it possible to visually analyze the data for patterns.
The visual output is analyzed to identify regions of interest, such as areas where paths frequently cross or converge, which may indicate underlying order within the randomness.
While true attractors are not expected in a pure Random Walk, the visualization might still reveal interesting, dense formations due to the nature of the DSC and the scale of data aggregation.

This approach leverages the inherent unpredictability of Random Walks and the parallel processing capabilities of a distributed network to explore a broad spectrum of stochastic behaviors. By applying DSC and visualization techniques to this exploration, the project seeks to discover patterns that, while not attractors in the classical sense, may exhibit a form of emergent order or statistical regularity that is aesthetically and analytically captivating.

## ESP32

ESP32 contains a hardware random number generator, values from it can be obtained using the APIs esp_random() 
Get one random 32-bit word from hardware RNG.

If Wi-Fi or Bluetooth are enabled, this function returns true random numbers. In other situations, if true random numbers are required then consult the ESP-IDF Programming Guide “Random Number Generation” section for necessary prerequisites.

This function automatically busy-waits to ensure enough external entropy has been introduced into the hardware RNG state, before returning a new random number. This delay is very short (always less than 100 CPU cycles).

Outcomes: _Perfect randomness_ - by the looks of the visualization - no patterns, random distribution of points in the space.

# Promisc

* esp32 promisc length of packet including Frame Check Sequence(FCS)
  
  Outcomes: Beautifull structure revealed by the visualization technique suggests a certain level of regularity and pattern in the transmission of data packets.

  The areas where points congregate could indicate common packet sizes or frequent data bursts. In network traffic, these could be due to standard packet sizes set by protocols or frequent message types.     The dense areas suggest that these packet sizes are common, while sparser areas would represent less common packet sizes
  In the context of network data, we might not be dealing with attractors in the traditional dynamical systems sense but rather with "attractors" of typical behavior.
  For example, if certain packet sizes are more prevalent due to the underlying protocol optimizations or data transmission patterns, they might form attractor-like structures.

* esp32 promisc RSSI of 100000 frames
  
  This image presents another compelling visualization, this time focusing on the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) of Wi-Fi frames, which has been plotted using Delayed Space Coordinates
  
  Signal Strength Distribution: The RSSI values are indicative of the signal strength at which the Wi-Fi frames are received. A dense cluster of points may signify that the signal strength for a large number of frames is consistently within a certain range.

  Spatial Patterns: The Delayed Space Coordinates method can reveal certain patterns that may indicate repetitive or periodic characteristics in signal strength. If these patterns are circular or elliptical, it could imply a cyclic nature of the signal's strength changes over time or space.
  
  Outcomes: While this may not depict a classical attractor found in dynamical systems, the dense central region could metaphorically be considered as an attractor, indicating that the RSSI values tend to "cluster" around this region more frequently than others.
  The convergence of lines towards the center suggests a commonality in the RSSI readings, possibly the most frequent values or a mean signal strength around which other values fluctuate.Points that diverge significantly from the central clusters could represent outliers in signal strength, possibly due to interference, distance from the source, or other anomalies.

# BINARY

When looking for interesting attractor(like) structures, we deep dive to binary visualization.
Outcomes: The observation of different binary files look similar, especially around the "core,". 
This similarity can be attributed to the common structures that binary files often share, such as headers, standard metadata, and sometimes even common code libraries. 
Other (non compiled binaries) reveal their own structures that are aligned with their internal format.

## TEMPERATURE

* Temperature readings from 2021 (full year)
  
  Outcomes: The dense core suggests a strong central tendency in the temperature data, meaning there's a range of temperature values that occur more frequently than others. This is often seen in temperature data due to consistent seasonal patterns.Fluctuations from this core may represent seasonal changes, with less frequent extreme temperatures occurring farther from the center.
Temperature typically changes in a continuous, rather than discrete, manner. This means that readings will often be clustered around a moving average, creating a dense region in a visualization like this one. Any points that are far from the dense core might represent anomalous days where the temperature was significantly higher or lower than the norm for that time of year.

# SDR
Using an SDR (Software Defined Radio) device to explore the noise from surroundings.
The electromagnetic noise captured by an SDR is essentially a time series of signal strengths that can be quite complex, influenced by a wide array of factors such as human-made signals, natural atmospheric phenomena, and cosmic sources. 

## Capture the Data

- Tune to an Empty Frequency: Find a frequency that is not used for any active transmission. The noise in this empty channel might be more indicative of natural or environmental electromagnetic noise.
- Broad Spectrum Analysis: Alternatively, capture a broad spectrum of frequencies. This can give more comprehensive dataset that includes various sources of noise and signals.
- Raw IQ Data: Record the raw IQ (in-phase and quadrature) data, which preserves the full information of the received signal and would be more suitable for complex analysis.
